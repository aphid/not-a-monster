				"text": "Congratulate yourself for the mistakes you have made along the way. Pour water into a cup or glass. Pour until you reach the top, but do not allow the water to overflow. Watch the surface tension. Do not attempt to pick up the glass. Instead, lean forward, put your lips to the edge, and slurp enough to safely pick up the cup or glass. Proceed to take two gulps, then breathe. Repeat until you have finished the water."

			{
				"day": 2,
				"text": "Think of a time when you dropped and broke something because you carried too many things. Replay the moment from your memory, and press the imaginary pause button right before you added that extra item that would inevitably break. Tell yourself, “Don’t worry, you will not need [insert item name here] anyway. Please let it go.” Repeat if you think of another instance of something breaking in your care (this includes your own heart)."
			},
			{
				"day": 3,
				"text": "Indulge in a pleasurable activity such as baking and eating cookies or making simple, comforting food that you then put into a bowl when you feel heat simmering in your body from frustration. As you embody your chosen activity, connect with a trusted friend in whatever form(at) you wish, share what you have made, or ask them to engage in the same activity."
			},
			{
				"day": 4,
				"text": "Play a song with no words that incorporates a sound or instrument you love. The minute you feel your eyes welling up with tears from the exhaustion you feel, find a seat, place your hand on your knees, back straight, and face the direction of the closest entrance (or opening), such as a door or window. Take a long breath in and exhale until you cannot do so, and envision the fatigue floating and leaving out of this opening. As you listen to the music, let the most tired parts of you be carried away by the music."
			},
			{
				"day": 5,
				"text": "Clasp your hands together by interlocking your fingers when you feel like screaming or yelling. Before this urge finds its way to the papillae of your tongue and turns your words bitter, grab the nape of your neck, interlocking your fingers once more, and slowly, with care, caress your neck until your fingers reach the front of your neck. Feel the heat from your hands and apply as much pressure as needed to soothe the throat. This action may induce crying, and is not only permissible but welcome."
			},
			{
				"day": 6,
				"text": "Stop and close your eyes the second you feel like throwing something against the wall in anger, or something has not gone your way. Open your eyes, hold up your left hand, wiggle your fingers, and take notice of the lines of your palm and the small muscles that allow you to make a fist. Proceed to take your right index finger and place it outside of your left thumb and trace your left hand as slowly as possible."
			},
			{
				"day": 7,
				"text": "You find yourself at the portion of the day where you look at the clock or a watch and start to panic about the time left to run errands or do the things you promised yourself you would do. Take your index fingers and begin to trace your eyebrows. You may use your middle and ring fingers to feel the fullness of your brows. Think about the things you can do tomorrow, and think about who might be able to support you. Ask them."
			},
			{
				"day": 8,
				"text": "When you are asked to take on yet another task and start to feel overwhelmed (and, maybe, underappreciated), make your way to the bedroom, grab the nearest pillow (it does not matter the softness or firmness), and scream into the fabric of the pillowcase. Let the pillow soften your scream and relieve the built-up tension of what feels like a balancing act of a thousand things. You do not need to be doing great or be reminded that “you got this.” It is good enough to know you are feeling something, anything at all."
			},
			{
				"day": 9,
				"text": "If you feel pain, whether sharp or dull, stop what you are doing and stand as still as you can. It does not have to be for an extended time, but it is vital to stop all activity. Rest the frenetic feet stepping from one place to another. Halt your fingers from typing or tapping messages that can wait to be sent. Notice the struggle and tension of realizing you must also be cared for."
			},
			{
				"day": 10,
				"text": "When you hear the sound of the voice you love but feel resentment bubbling to the surface of all the things you have done, coupled with not feeling as if you are doing enough, interrupt your thoughts and movements (if mid-step, mid-gesture, or mid-movement). Listen to your surroundings. Proceed to name each thing you hear until your loved one's voice becomes sweet again."
			},
			{
				"day": 11,
				"text": "When you start to feel a deluge of intense and intrusive thoughts enter your mind and feel the distraction is growing beyond your control, take a moment, if you can do so, whether outside or inside, find a place where you can touch a leaf from a plant or a tree closest to you. Look as closely as you can to the point where you can see the veins and venules. Press your palms together with the leaf in between them, and make a wish for your immediate calm, your comfort."
			},
			{
				"day": 12,
				"text": "If you feel that you are grasping, holding, clasping, or clenching too tightly to a past wrong or something that has led to your experiencing a dull ache in your heart that feels as if it will never go away, find a piece or clothing or textile with a loose thread. Pull on the thread. Unravel the garment or cloth as you think of this sorrow unraveling and coming undone. Keep pulling on this thread until there is no semblance of the material. You may discard it, but if you hang onto it, use it as a thread to bind something that might be broken or torn with it."
			},
			{
				"day": 13,
				"text": "When you feel your eyes welling up with tears, find the roundest, yet roughest, stone wherever you find yourself. Hold it gently in your left palm and allow the stone’s surface to collect as many tears as needed. Wrap your fingers around it. If you continue to cry, even sob uncontrollably, please don’t forget to take long, slow breaths. Open your palm to cry into the stone’s porous surface. If you are close to a body of water, hold it with your dominant hand or whichever one you feel most comfortable with and throw it as far as possible. If you can’t bear to thrust it as far away as possible, do this with a loved one. Have them throw it into the water and watch the ripples together."
			},
			{
				"day": 14,
				"text": "Fill up the bathtub with water, close your eyes, gulp as much air as possible, dunk your head, and now scream like you've never screamed. Scream as if the undulations from the ripples your voice causes reverberate into the porcelain. Relieve yourself from the pressure. Take your head out, pull the plug, and watch the whirling of the water spin faster and faster as your scream drains into the network of tears, dirt, sweat, and blood of others who have screamed in unison with you. Somewhere, out there, in the world of billions."
			},
			{
				"day": 15,
				"text": "Bring your hands (palms) together. Rub them together, creating friction that begins to generate warmth. Hold your hands together while creating an opening as if you are holding a small object.  Bring your hands up to your face, fingertips pressed. The tips of your thumbs touch your lips. Take a deep breath and breathe the warm air into the enclosed space between your hands. Feel the warmth of your breath circulating against your palms. Repeat until you gently close your eyes."
			},
			{
				"day": 16,
				"text": "Reach out to someone who makes you feel calm and comforted in times of distress. However you decide to connect with them, whether through a call or whatever form of communication you decide, ask them one or all of these questions: Would it be possible to tell me why you care about me? How would you feel if I suddenly vanished? Do you have the capacity and time to tell me about a time when your heart broke and you did not think your heart would mend, but it did and became stronger than before your heart was broken?"
			},
			{
				"day": 17,
				"text": "Stand as still as possible. Feel the temperature of your immediate surroundings on your skin, face, and hands. You might feel tired or anxious from all of the errands and priorities arising from your day. Your nerves feel like the burnt wicks of a bright, burning candle slowly reaching its end. Allow yourself to drift, even for a moment. From the melting wax of this imaginary candle, think of it burning in reverse to the point of the candle being lit. Before the struck match touches the fresh wick, pause this moment in your mind. Set an intention for this candle you are about to burn. Return to the present moment and allow your younger self to receive this much-needed intention from earlier in the day. Thinking back on the day is a gift, even if parts of what we wished untouched might have been scorched throughout the day. From the minutiae of the day to the more grandiose, some things are meant to diminish and become ash."

			{
				"day": 18,
				"text": "Find a fresh piece of paper. Run your fingers as gently as possible across its surface. Take as many long, deep inhalations as possible for at least two minutes. Then, with a pen or pencil, write one thing you need to let go of in the present moment (or, for some time, maybe, even forever). On the other hand, write what you need most in your life: to feel loved and held. Write about how it allows you to be yourself with all your imperfections. Fold this piece of paper as many times as possible and proceed to select a plant or sacred place in nature. Bury the two sides, allow them to co-exist, and allow the other to hold both the sorrow and the joy."
			},
			{
				"day": 19,
				"text": "Take your index and middle fingers. Touch the top of your forehead and slowly draw the outline of your face. Concentrate on the sensation you feel as you breathe into the motion. Once you reach the bottom of your face, feeling your chin, start over. When bringing your fingers back up to your forehead, do not rush. Every single time, attempt to move your fingers slower and slower until you feel a lightness and pressure of your fingertips starts to produce a lingering tingle. If you have been crying, do not attempt to wipe any more tears that may trickle down with a tissue. Rather, allow your fingertips to trace where your tears fall. Catch them with your finger tips and hold them. Allow them to dry, evaporate."
			},
			{
				"day": 20,
				"text": "Contact one of your closest and most trustworthy friends or companions. This friend ought to be a loved one with whom you are able to be yourself. Imagine them in your position of giving care or feeling the weight of responsibilities. How might you be present for how they are feeling? What gestures or acts of service might they need from you? While we cannot be everything all at once for everyone around us, especially ourselves when we need the support of others the most, in what little ways can we allow ourselves the help we feel we need? Allow yourself to envision what you might offer to your friend as something you might offer to yourself. Proceed by putting into practice a simple question of asking your loved one, “I need support with groceries. Would it be possible to accompany me?” or “I would like to finish this book, but having trouble, is there any way to visit me and maybe take turns reading to one another?” The thing is…as a culture and society, we often find creative ways of finding solutions to problems that might not be problems. Yet how might we grow increasingly creative in the ways we offer care and receive care."
			},
			{
				"day": 21,
				"text": "Make a list of all the things you wish people did not say to you as a caregiver. Some might include phrases such as “You’re doing great,” “I can’t imagine what you have gone through and how much strength that requires,” “You’re so strong,” or “You carry so much, I hope you are resting.” At first, these statements might cause anger or possibly rage. Yet are they not true? Despite not feeling great or particularly strong, you have been tasked with taking on a tremendous amount of intellectual, emotional, and physical labor. Caregiving often means, you have been charged with the care of another human being(s) and this requires confronting the things that, deep down, might stir a deep and intense sadness because grief and loss often accompany our feelings of rage that we are told are not healthy. Yet those feelings come from something feel unjust or unfair. Return to the list you made and honor that what you might be feeling is sadness and frustration that you might not feel allowed to your anger, rage, and disappointment. All of those feelings are most welcome here."
			},
			{
				"day": 22,
				"text": "Remember that we all care for something or someone. Whether human or non-human, we are all in relation(ship) to that which needs our care, our love, and our support. Yet have you forgotten that you are also subject to support, love, and care in the way that you have given to another? When you are feeling weak, tired, exhausted, and feeling depleted, where do you turn? What does it feel like to imagine the care you give someone given to you? Think of this role reversal with intention. Return to a thought or situation where someone asked for your guidance or advice. In good faith, you might have suggested engaging in conversation or taking a step back. How might you ask yourself what needs to be tended to in this very moment. Take a moment to sit down in a chair or maybe on your bed with a pillow. Wrap your arms around the pillow and embrace it, but not too tight. Allow yourself to dip your head into the softest part and say (whisper, or speak out loud, or say in your head), “I will tend to you the way I tend to others.” In this case, and always, remember the “you” is YOU. It is you that needs tending to."
			},
			{
				"day": 23,
				"text": "Reflect on a time when you felt like you were about to lose your patience. You were in the flow of an activity that you believed that you had the time, spaciousness, and capacity to do. Then, you were interrupted and you could feel your face and body fill up with a heat often associated with a heart quickening and irritability scratching at your throat and chest as if needing to escape your body because you recognize that your body cannot contain the frustration that requires a release. Unfortunately, the words that leave your mouth are filled with frustrated, heavy sighs. You're angry because you feel like a servant and doing seemingly thankless work. Please remember that your work yesterday, today, and tomorrow are vital for the survival and care of another human being. It is human to be upset, to be angry, and feel that you are not being seen for all the multitudes you contain. But they are there and please remember these multitudes the next time you start to feel guilt or shame for experiencing truly human sensations. You are alive."

				"day": 24,
				"text": "The next time you have the urge to respond to the question, “How are you?” with “Fine” or “I’m OK,” what might it feel like to reimagine and allow yourself to say, “I’m not OK, but I will be OK” or “Not well, but doing the best I can.” Often, the challenge has more to do with what we tell ourselves about the care we give more than the care we receive. What would it feel like to tell someone that you are feeling intense sadness and a deep ache or responding to the question “How might I help” with “I welcome your support, but I’m not sure what to ask for.” Balancing uncertainty with the certainty and desire to care for yourself. It is not a matter of want, rather, you need the care that you give. Today, let someone do something for you. Whether it is making you a hot cup of tea or allowing you to cry like a child who lost their parents, allow yourself to receive."
			},
			{
				"day": 25,
				"text": "Circle back to a moment where you felt susceptible to self-destruction. When you felt a deep sense of annihilation or that your heart was about to detonate as if someone pulled the pin out of a grenade. The accumulation of hurt, anger, and rage was bundled tight like shrapnel. You may start to feel heat. Maybe your skin starts to feel pinpricks in parts you may have never noticed. Take the index and middle fingers of your dominant hand and place them on your non-dominant wrist. Search for your pulse. Once you have found it, inhale for four, hold for four, exhale for four. Try your best not to chase your heartbeat. Breathe at a rate that allows you to steady yourself."
			},
			{
				"day": 26,
				"text": "When the chatter in your mind gets too loud to the point of being unable to focus, find the largest piece of paper you can find. It doesn’t have to be fancy paper. You may use a newspaper or wrapping paper, if available. Reach for a marker, pen, or pencil. If you prefer to use paint, feel free to use whatever calls to you. Start from a corner or the center and draw a continuous line in whichever direction you please. Spiral. Straight and jagged lines. Curved lines with dips or crescents. Draw or paint the topography of your brain’s surface. Let your hand guide the mark-making. If it feels and looks like static, sound waves, or frequencies that are unrecognizable. Maybe even jagged with lines too close, too far apart, or erratic, go with it. Once you have filled the piece of paper, step away, let it sit. Wait for five or ten minutes. You might want to wait one day, a week, or a month. But it is essential to return to what you created. Find where you ended, place your finger on the endpoint, trace the lines you made, in reverse so that you end where you began."
			},
			{
				"day": 27,
				"text": "There is a message you would like to send, but you have not sent it yet. Re-trace your steps, gestures, and correspondence of a time you wish you could say what you needed to say or send what you wish was the outcome. Although you might not be in a place to give or receive, take a piece of paper or whatever is most convenient to write with. Write the message you wish to have shared. You don’t need to feel resolution. Allow yourself to feel the distance from that time to now. Try your best not to feel guilty; instead, allow yourself to feel sadness for the time lost. You cannot and will not make up days; it’s not possible. However, it is possible to say that you will allow for the void to feel less significant and take up less room. Do not let it course through your veins or to swim freely through the water contained in your body."
			},
			{
				"day": 28,
				"text": "Stop whatever you are doing right now. Walk to a part of the room, house, or wherever you find yourself. Look for something you have not noticed before. This will take some time because you might find yourself thinking that you are familiar with your surroundings. Trust me, there is something that you have not noticed before. Look with care. Scan your surroundings. Find what you are looking for. There is no need for frustration because, remember, you are searching for something you did not recognize before. If you find yourself defeated, proceed to wherever you can see your reflection. No search for something in your face that you have not paid close attention to in the past. Freckles. A new wrinkle. Maybe, a laugh line. Make a funny face. Take a long look at yourself. Now, repeat: You are not a Monster. No matter your feelings. No matter how difficult. No matter how much your heart aches. No matter how angry and hurt you feel. You are not a Monster."
